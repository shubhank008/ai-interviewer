# Plan NNN - <feature name>

## Global Constraints

<!-- The single most useful section. List every invariant from AGENTS.md this
     feature could plausibly violate, so they are in front of whoever (or
     whatever) implements it BEFORE the first line is written. Example: -->


## Marker contract

Written in `contracts/log-markers.md` before implementation. Summarize here:

- Requires: `[FEAT] <exact string the module will print>`
- Forbids: standard failure patterns (`Script Error`, `nil value`, ...)

## Work order

1. <file to touch> - <what changes>
2. ...

## Test plan

- Unit: <which pure modules, which new test files>
- e2e: <which markers prove it live; smoke or full run>
- Frames: <what a reviewer must SEE for visual features>
